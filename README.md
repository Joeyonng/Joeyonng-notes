This repository hosts my personal website where I primarily used to share my summaries on general machine learning methods (Knowledge) and 
my reading notes of the related papers (Notes). 

My goal is to make my notes **formal**, **comprehensive** and most importantly, 
**easy-to-read**.

This repository is far from complete and I will continue to cover more topics 
as I learn more in my PhD journey. 

Feel free to point any error you found in my notes. Any suggestions will be much
appreciated!.
