    "1. Linear regression is a supervised machine learning model that fits a correlation linear line between input and label variables. The output value can be arbitrary continuous value and thus it is used for regression. \n",
    "2. The model has a weight vector and a bias as parameters. The output of the model is the dot product of the weight vector and the input vector plus a bias value. \n",
    "3. The linear regression model is trained by solving an optimization problem that is defined by applying a cost function that evaluates the difference between the model's output and the correct labels. The cost function for linear regression is mean squared error function that takes the mean of the squared value of each prediction's error. MSE for linear regression is proved to be convex, so solving it using convex optimization or gradient descent will get the global minimum. \n",
    "4. Logistic regression is similar to linear regression, but the output is a probability value between 0 and 1, so it is used for binary classification instead of regression.\n",
    "5. A sigmoid (logistic) function is attached after the output of linear regression to output a probability for logistic regression. Instead of using MSE, the cost function is changed to binary cross entropy such that the loss grows exponentially with the difference between outputs and labels."

    "If a function with single input and output $y = f(x)$ is a linear function, it represents a straight line on the coordinate plane. Thus it has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = wx + b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept of the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "A linear function can also take multiple inputs and we can represent $n$ inputs with a vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then the equation changes to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{w}$ is called **weights** or the weight vector and $b$ is called **bias**.\n",

    "Linear regression is a supervised regression model that simply fits a linear function between the inputs $\\mathbf{x}$ and output $y$. \n",

    "Loss function is a function that measures the error between the labels predicted by your current model and the true labels for a set of instances (training set).\n",

    "Linear regression minimizes the a particular loss function called **mean squared error (MSE)** function. Given a set of training labels $\\mathbf{y} = y_{1}, y_{2}, \\dots, y_{n}$ for $n$ training instances and the predicted labels $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\hat{y}_{1}, \\hat{y}_{2}, \\dots, \\hat{y}_{n}$ for the same instances, MSE is defined as: \n",
