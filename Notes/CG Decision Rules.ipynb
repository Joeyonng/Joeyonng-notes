    "## Problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "These paper try to find a decision rule set as a binary classifier by fomulating a integer programming problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A decision rule set is a binary classifier that only takes binary inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The decision rule set is in the form of DNF (OR-of-ANDs). Each rule is an AND gate of part of the binary inputs and all rules are connected using an OR gate. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. If a instance satisfies any of the rules, it is predicted to be positive. Otherwise, the instance is predicted to be negative.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Learning a set of decision rule set can be formulated as a large mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. A rule is a subset of input features. If there are $m$ binary input features, a rule can be represented by a binary vector of length $m$ (1 means the feature is included in the rule, 0 otherwise).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Let $\\mathcal{K}$ denotes all possible DNF rules. $\\mathcal{K}$ has in total $2^{m} - 1$ of rules (a vector of all 0 is not a rule). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Given a training set that has a set of positive instances $\\mathcal{P}$ and a set of negative instances $\\mathcal{N}$, we can minimize a loss function that characterize the classification error."
